# ðŸ”§ env.example generator
This is forked project from https://github.com/hackcode-packages/env-example-generator

---

Ever wanted to try out someone's project and kept figuring out all the environment variables that were needed ? Or you are just too lazy to document the same in your own project ? Worry not !

This is a simple npm package that will read through the entire codebase (don't worry, only javascript and typescript files) of your project, and create a `.env.example` file with all the environment configurations that are used in the code.

---

## Usage

```bash
# install the package using
sudo npm i -g @turnkeyid/env-example-generator

# run the cli from the project root
create-env-example

# An .env.example file would be created
```
